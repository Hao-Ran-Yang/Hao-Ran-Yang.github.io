<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I'm Hao-Ran Yang (officially, Haoran Yang), a third-year master's student in the School of Mathematics at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU), where I also completed my bachelor's degree. My research interests lie in applied mathematics and machine learning. I am particularly interested in how prior knowledge can be mathematically modeled and integrated into the design, training, and adaptation of models. 

I am always open to research collaborations and internship opportunities‚Äîplease feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in working with me.   

Beyond academics, I am passionate about orienteering. As a student-athlete on SYSU's orienteering team, I have represented the school in Chinese Orienteering Championship and other major competitions. I deeply enjoy the process of reading maps, exploring the unknown, and reaching checkpoints, which gives me a unique sense of freedom and accomplishment.
